        <p>Lindokuhle Shabangu is a  26 year old aspiring web developer from South Africa. </br>
          I hold a BSc in Information Techology from Richfield Graduate Institute of Techology,  I first got interested in techology from playing archade game while growing up and from there on I always wondered what was the thought process behing those games, how were they created and all of that.<br></p>
        <p>That's when I decided that I would do an IT course once I finish matric, which I did in 2016 and graduated on the 10th of May 2019. I never really got my dream job of becoming a Web/Software Engineer but I have been working within the Tech space . I applied to be part of the PLP ACademy becuase I have heard a lot of successful stoires about their alumni  and I believe that the programme will help me to be where I want to be and it is never to late to start over as long as you have the vision and dedication.</p>
